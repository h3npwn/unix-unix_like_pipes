# unix-unix_like_pipes
**Pipex** is a project from the **42 curriculum** that aims to recreate the behavior of the **Unix shell pipe (`|`)** using C.   It teaches process control, inter-process communication (IPC), and file descriptor redirection by handling **multiple commands** and their **input/output streams** manually.
